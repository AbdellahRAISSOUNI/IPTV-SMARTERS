# Blog Image Preview System

## Problem
Images uploaded to the blog editor weren't showing previews because they needed to be committed and deployed to GitHub before being accessible.

## Solution
Implemented **immediate image preview** using browser Blob URLs:

### How It Works

1. **Upload Process**:
   - When user selects an image file, we create a temporary Blob URL using `URL.createObjectURL(file)`
   - Image preview shows **immediately** using the Blob URL
   - File uploads to GitHub in the background
   - After upload completes, we keep both the Blob URL (for preview) and the GitHub URL (for storage)

2. **Display Logic**:
   - Editor uses `getImageDisplayUrl()` helper function
   - Returns Blob URL if available (immediate preview)
   - Falls back to GitHub URL once deployed
   - This ensures images always show in the editor

3. **Public Pages**:
   - Added `onError` handlers to hide images that aren't deployed yet
   - Images gracefully fail without breaking the layout
   - Once deployed to GitHub and live on Vercel, images load normally

### Files Modified

1. **`components/admin/BlogEditor.tsx`**:
   - Added `imagePreviewUrls` state to store Blob URL mappings
   - Modified `handleImageUpload()` to create and store Blob URLs
   - Modified `handleImageBlockUpload()` to show preview immediately
   - Added `getImageDisplayUrl()` helper to get correct URL
   - Updated all `<img>` tags to use `getImageDisplayUrl()`
   - Clean up Blob URLs when images are removed

2. **`components/admin/BlogsManager.tsx`**:
   - Added `onError` handler to hide images that fail to load
   - Images that aren't deployed yet won't break the layout

3. **`app/[locale]/blog/page.tsx`**:
   - Added `onError` handler for featured images
   - Blog listing page handles missing images gracefully

4. **`app/[locale]/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`**:
   - Fixed React key prop error in heading rendering
   - Moved `key` prop out of spread object

### Benefits

✅ **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Users see images instantly after upload  
✅ **Better UX**: No waiting for GitHub deployment to see previews  
✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Public pages handle missing images elegantly  
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Works with existing deployment workflow  

### Memory Management

- Blob URLs are revoked when images are removed to prevent memory leaks
- URLs are cleaned up properly when component unmounts

## Testing

1. Upload an image in the blog editor → Should see it immediately
2. Save the blog → Image URL is stored in data/blogs.json
3. View in blog management → Preview shows (or gracefully fails if not deployed)
4. After GitHub deployment → Images load from actual URLs
5. Public blog pages → Images show once deployed, hidden if not yet available
